	- https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html#use-gzip-compression
	- http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_module.html
- [ ] instead of calling setMidiNotes all the time to trigger notes, use AudioParam automation to queue up note changes in the future based off of what is in a sequencer
- [ ] make it obvious that master audio output node is local only
	- maybe make a local audio slider that's not a part of the graph

	- a node group that can have multiple nodes stacked on top of eachother with them connecting top down

# Optimizations
- [ ] use debounce for some network updates like mouse cursors and node positions?

# DevOps
- [ ] figure out how to do `yarn build` without stopping parcel and the server

# Shared Cursors
- [ ] make shared cursor not block pointer events
- [√] use relative positioning like the connections so it doesn't have to rerender on scroll
- [ ] optimize
	- [ ] less updates over network
	- [ ] less dispatches
- [ ] interpolate

# Sampler
- [ ] fix missing piano note

# Clean Code
- [√] use `strictNullChecks` typescript config
- [ ] `tslint:all`

# Connections
- [ ] make it obvious which direction data flows
- [√] brighten the connectors and line when data is going across it
- [√] make them moveable
- [√] fix invisible long line when vertical (kind of fixed by only being curved lines now?)
- [√] make input connector look like a stack cable when multiple inputs
- [√] animate dashed ghost connector
- [ ] animate active connections in the direction that data is flowing
- [ ] show ghost connector for adding connections when mouse is near, and put it at top of connector stack, don't require ctrl to be held down
- [ ] have a node that hands out connections
	- [ ] like a needle cushion
- [ ] show move icon on connector on hover
	- now shows grab icon when moving, but hand icon on hover is too big
- [ ] visually differentiate between midi and audio connections (and both)

## Adding/Changing/Removing Connections
should anything allow multiple incoming connections?
- yes, instruments will union the incoming notes together
	- for an audio node it would need a mixer node or something

if you click and drag the output side of a connection, it moves it
if you click and drag from the input side of a connection and starts a new connection

- [√] allow multiple inputs and multiple outputs

possible starting points:
- deleting connections
- moving output side of connection
- creating new connections from the output of a node

- [ ] adding new connections
	- [√] control click and drag on connector to mak new connector
	- [ ] show icon with message when hovering over a connector saying to hold control to add new connection
	- [ ] allow making new connections from a node with no connections on it

## Updating web audio graph
when i break the connection from an instrument to the audio output i want sound to stop
i want the instrument to disconnect from w/e audio node it is connected to

- [√] give instruments a disconnect and connect function

connections middleware?
when a connection source or target is changed, or is a new connection or a connection was deleted
if the source or target of the connection was changed, (or new or deleted conection)
	then call the necessary functions on the instruments involved to update the web audio graph
	
instrument manager?

what are the types of nodes that have an audio graph component?
- intruments
- audio output
- future
	- effects
	- audio inputs (microphone, external instruments)

how to tell what to connect to what in the instrument manager?

make Instrument implement the AudioNode interface?
	pass through stuff to the underlying audio node

make it so intsrument doesnt take a destination at construction
instead all connections must be done my the instrument manager
instrument manager already handles all creation and destruction of instruments
- [√] when an instrument gets created, look to see if it has an outgoing connection
- [√] see if connection is connected to anything
- [√] see if connection target is an audio node thing?
- [√] if it is, use the targets input audio node as the output audio node for the new instrument

# Keyboard
- [ ] do something to visualize external midi keyboard notes
- [ ] show icon or something to show which users are using an external midi keyboard

# Knob
- [ ] Allow for arc to go both directions
	- like a pan knob, when centered should have no arc, and arc can go left or right from center

# Sequencers
- [ ] limit undo history
- [ ] redo button
- [ ] click and drag midi to ableton from shamu
- [ ] click and drag midi from ableton to shamu
- [ ] click and drag midi files from computer to shamu

## GridSequencer
- [ ] make size adjustable
	- use react-draggable
	- drop down with size options?
- [√] global play button
- [ ] input notes from keyboard
- [ ] allow using scroll wheel

### GridSequencer Scroll Bar
- [ ] make slider stay with mouse 1:1
- [√] mini map

## Infinite Sequencer
- [ ] click and drag notes left and right to change order, up and down to change note
- [√] find better way to clear notes
- [ ] fix recording and playing at same time
	- what is this problem?
- [√] undo button
- [√] record button should be red when recording
- [√] backspace to undo note while recording

# BasicSynthesizer
- [√] voices still round robin, instead it should pick voices that aren't playing

# Rooms
- [√] switch rooms
- [√] create rooms
- [√] lobby
- [√] put user in new room when they click new room button
- [√] BUG: If user is holding down a note key when they change rooms the notes keep playing and you cant stop it
- [√] handle user joining a room that doesn't exist
- [√] delete empty rooms every 5 seconds
- [ ] *choose name for room at creation
- [√] *join room by url
- [ ] *better UX
- [ ] rename existing rooms
- [ ] room ownership
- [ ] create more lobbies automatically when lobby is full
- [ ] observers (users who can join room but not play)
	- permissions system
- [ ] limit number of rooms?
- [ ] assign a room a color
- [ ] room types
	- [ ] single keyboard
	- [ ] advanced
	- etc.
- [ ] show member count for each room in room selector

# Global Clock
- [√] clicking play should reset global index to 0
- [√] stop it when nothing is playing
- [ ] make downstream nodes actually depend on the connection from the master clock

# Newsletter

# Chat
- [ ] delete old chat messages
- [√] Hit enter to focus chat
- [ ] play sound when new message?
- [ ] make new messages start at full opacity then fade to whatever the normal opacity is
- [√] make chat bottom bar always in front?

# Username
- when change name, should we change the name in old chat messages?
- [√] update name in bottom left on blur of name input
- [√] save name in local storage and us on re-entry

# SimpleGraph
- [√] move last touched node to highest z index
	- who should keep track of the last touched node?
	- react draggable?
	- redux?
		- positions?
	- should this be networked?
		- preferably
			- that means redux
	- [√] positions redux
		- [√] lastTouchedId
	- to make sure that the zindex order renders the same on everyones computer,
		we need to make sure that things are rendered in order
		sort by id in selector? or in reducer?
	- maybe use an ordered map?
		- ordered map won't work, need a sorted map
			- https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/issues/88
	- [√] sort by id in reducer
	- [√] when a position is updated, mark it as last touched
	- [√] maybe store zIndex on each position state?
		- will automatically get synced to server
		- allows for more complex ordering
	- [√] mark as last touched immediately after clicking on node
- [√] support trackpad zoom and pan
- [ ] add buttons on side of screen for zoom and pan and show keyboard shortcuts when hovering over icon
- [√] different icon for drag handle so people don't think it's a menu
- [ ] auto organize button
- [√] center master clock node vertically in create server stuff
- [ ] allow moving multiple nodes at once (like blender or unit shader graph?)

# Bugs
- [√] shift click note not showing on other clients
- [√] long usernames mess up the keyboard
- [√] long usernames mess up the chat input
- [ ] sequencer doesn't always play when joining room with a playing sequencer
- [√] can't click chat on short window
- [ ] review chrome autoplay fix
	- https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes#webaudio
- [√] instrument keeps playing afer owner leaves
- [√] stop drag ghost connector running middleware func on all clients
- [ ] when adding a new connector, one ghost connector is in wrong place
