# Proposed Shamu Node State and Reducer

	- connections
	- positions
	- nodes (collection of node states; each node state can be of a specific type with unique properties)

- [ ] take a look at how redux-form organizes state with different types of inputs

- the nodes reducer will choose the right reducer to use for each node based off of its type
